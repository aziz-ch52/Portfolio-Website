# Aziz Chharchhodawala | Data Analyst Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my personal data analytics portfolio website. It is a custom-built, static web application designed to showcase my expertise in **SQL, Python, Power BI, and Business Intelligence**.

The site is built with performance and clean code in mind, utilizing **no external styling frameworks** (like Bootstrap) to demonstrate strong fundamental technical understanding.

## 🚀 Overview

This portfolio serves as a central hub for my data analysis case studies. Unlike generic templates, this site was built from scratch to reflect a "Business-First" mindset—prioritizing clarity, speed, and decision-ready insights.

- **Live Demo:** https://aziz-ch52.github.io/Portfolio-Website/

## ✨ Key Features

- **Custom Interactive Visualizations:** Features a hero section with a custom-coded HTML5 Canvas chart (`script.js`) that renders data bars dynamically without heavy charting libraries.
- **3D CSS Transforms:** Specific "Glassmorphism" and 3D skew effects for project mockups using pure CSS3.
- **Responsive Architecture:** Fully responsive layout built using CSS Grid and Flexbox (Mobile-first approach).
- **Scroll Animations:** Custom Intersection Observer logic to trigger fade-in animations as the user scrolls.
- **Dark Mode UI:** A modern, high-contrast dark theme optimized for readability and visual appeal.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** Semantic structure for accessibility and SEO.
- **CSS3:** Advanced usage of CSS Variables (`:root`), Animations (`@keyframes`), and Media Queries.
- **JavaScript (ES6+):** Vanilla JS for DOM manipulation, canvas rendering, and navigation logic.
- **FontAwesome:** For UI icons.
- **Google Fonts:** Inter & JetBrains Mono typography.
